# Integrated Computational Environment (ICE)

ICE is a graphical workflow editor for input, simulation setup, job launch and
analysis. The driving force behind ICE is the development of software that
provides an integrated set of capabilities for working with physics simulators
for creating input files, managing and analyzing data, launching jobs and code
coupling through data mapping. The framework was originally developed for the
Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation program (NEAMS), - a DOE NE
project. The capabilities of ICE for CAEBAT were designed specifically to aid
in simulation setup and job launch. Within the graphical interface the
selection of components (physics models), platforms, time-stepping schemes,
meshes, etc becomes much easier task. Further updated information can be found
on the [ICE project webpage][]. Visualization of the simulation results is
executed through a connection to the external visualization software
application, [VisIt][]. Detailed description of ICE usage to set up and run a
simulation is provided in Appendix B.
