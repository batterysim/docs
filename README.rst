Documentation for OAS and VIBE
==============================

Documentation for the OAS and VIBE battery simulation tools is provided in PDF
and HTML format. `Pandoc <http://pandoc.org>`_ is required to build the
documentation from the markdown files. The Pandoc filters `citeproc` and
`crossref` also need to be installed. LaTeX is required to build the PDF document.

To build the documentation as a PDF, use the `make pdf` command to produce the
`docs.pdf` file. To build the HTML document, use the `make html` command to
create the `index.html` file which can be viewed at `batterysim.github.io/docs/
<https://batterysim.github.io/docs/>`_.
