# Virtual Integrated Battery Environment (VIBE)

We have added several components for modeling electrochemistry and mass,
electron, and heat transport in order to VIBE. The components that have been
integrated so far are:

Electrochemistry

- Pseudo 2D Dual-Foil (Doyle, Fuller et al. 1993; Fuller, Doyle et al. 1994; Fuller, Doyle et al. 1994)
- 3D electrochemistry model known as AMPERES
- NTG (Seong Kim, Yi et al. 2011)
- NREL MSMD (Kim, Smith et al. 2011)
- AMPERES Single Particle
- AMPERES Pseudo-2D

Thermal and Electrical

- AMPERES

Cost Model

- ANL cost model

Mechanics

- EPIC, LS-Dyna, LIGGGHTS/LAMMPS
